I have been playing [Xeno Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeno_Crisis) on my hacked Switch 1.

It is a 'Smash TV' style game, which is a retro game based on arena battles where you have to kill all the enemies in the arena before the doors open to other arenas. Smash TV itself was based on one of my favourite 1980s films '[The Running Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Running_Man_(1987_film))'.

Xeno Crisis is developed by [Bitmap Bureau](https://www.bitmapbureau.com/), which is a software house specialising in modern versions of games with retro game themes. It was released on a number of different consoles and platforms, including retro consoles like the Sega Megadrive.

The Switch version is meant to be a lot more difficult than the other consoles and has some problems with difficulty scaling. However I love it, and have been playing it a lot.

I want to get the Evercade version to see how that compares - apparently it has a different difficulty curve.
