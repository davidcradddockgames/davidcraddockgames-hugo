title: Epoch Light Gun Game Review
url: /epoch-light-gun-game-review

I setup and played the ['Epoch' rail-shooter game available on steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/270510/EPOCH/), with my Sinden light gun setup.

## Negatives

I have to say, I didn't like the mechanics of the game. The gameplay seemed pretty boring, and instead of one-shot-one-kill, you have to constantly 'wear down' enemies through shooting at them, and moving out of their way.

This doesn't really work very well on the Sinden light gun, as, although there are controls for moving - 4 buttons and a d-pad - on the gun, constantly having to switch to them and away from the 'aim and fire' action does not work very well.

There is so much grinding and the gameplay is pretty much the same throughout.

## Positives

The plus point that it is cheap, currently on sale for Â£2.


## Conclusion

If you have a full pedal setup in addition to a lightgun setup, which not many people do, then it might be more tolerable, but as it is, I can't recommend this game.
