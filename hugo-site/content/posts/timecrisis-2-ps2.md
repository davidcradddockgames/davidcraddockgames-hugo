---

I have built a good setup for single player Time Crisis 2 on the PC, using a PS2 emulator. It is only single player at the moment, I'm still working on the best way to enable two player.

## Software

* Time Crisis 2 (USA version) for PS2 - SLUS-210219

### Sinden Light Gun Utility Patched with Recoil support for Patched PS2 Emulator

* <a href="https://github.com/nixxou/SindenSoft/releases/tag/V1">Sinden Light Gun Utility</a>

### PCSX2 Emulator patched for Recoil

* <a href="https://github.com/nixxou/pcsx2/releases/tag/V1.1">PCSX2 Emulator</a>

### Time Crisis 2 Target Cursors

* <a href="https://mega.nz/folder/IiMzQTzR#yf8BWqult3kILq6dVPp4ZQ">Cursor pack</a>

* <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/my-ps2-packs.621422/">https://gbatemp.net/threads/my-ps2-packs.621422/</a>

## Hardware

### Foot Pedal

### Light Gun

* <a href="https://www.sindenshop.com/products/sinden-lightgun-with-recoil">Sinden Light Gun with Recoil</a>

### TV

* Sony 40" 1080p TV mounted on the wall

## Configuration Enabled

I will eventually upload my modified forks of both modified Sinden Light gun and modified PCSX2 to my github and put the link here - this will come with all the config you will need.

* Play in 4:3 (square resolution) as widescreen does not work with this game.
* I use the Sinden light gun border bezel.
* I use a scanlines filter to give the game a retro CRT look.

## Setup Process

1. Make sure the light guns are plugged into two separate USB powered hubs directly on the PC.
2. Make sure the pedals are plugged into the 2 long extension USB cables connected to the PC.
3. Make sure the keyboard and mouse on the arcade pedestal are switched on
4. Restart the PC to help prevent any transient problems
5. Go to the LightGun folder on F:\ and load the modified Sinden Light gun setup. Make sure the camera is working.
6. Enable the Sinden Border in 4:3 mode by pressing 'alt-b' twice
7. Turn off the small monitor that is mirroring the TV, you won't need that
8. Load the modified PCSX2 setup and load Time Crisis 2
9. In the light gun calibration mode, hold the back d-pad button for 3 seconds to align both the sinden light gun calibration with the game calibration
10. Press the pedal to exit the calibration screen when calibration is accurate
11. Play the game!
