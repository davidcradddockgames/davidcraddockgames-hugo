It was released in arcades in 1997, and later ported to the PlayStation 2 in 2001. It is the second instalment in the Time Crisis series.\nThe game features a two-player mode, where each player takes turns using a light gun to shoot enemies and reload. Players can duck behind cover to avoid enemy fire, and pop out to shoot enemies. The game also features a pedal that players can step on to pop out of cover and shoot enemies.\nI remember playing Time Crisis 2 in arcades when I was a kid. It was one of my favourite games to play with friends. The light gun was so much fun to use, and the pedal added an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay. I also loved the graphics and sound effects, which really added to the immersive experience.\nI recently bought a Sinden Light Gun with recoil to use with my PC via an emulator. I decided to get Time Crisis 2 and set it up to work with it, as I had a lot of fun in the arcades on it.\nI bought a second-hand PS2 Time Crisis 2 disc from ebay, and used the PS2 redump.org dumping guide to dump the PS2 iso for use with the PCSX2 PC PS2 emulator. I could have downloaded the image illegally but I really avoid doing that unless I absolutely have to.\nEven though you can get the Sinden Light Gun to work directly with my physical PS2 console via some hardware hackery, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do that, and preferred to use the PCSX2 emulator.\nWhen the Sinden Light Gun arrives, I am intending to get Time Crisis 2 running now on my 42\u0026quot; 1080p screen TV, with the Sinden light gun software working, and a cheap USB pedal for reload.\nI will also use Phillips Hue for lighting in my room so that the Phillips Hue home entertainment system and the lightstrip around my TV matches the colours of the edges of the TV.\nSound will be provided by my 2.1 sound system, EQ\u0026rsquo;d to the characteristics of my room by SonorWorks SoundID.\nIf this setup all works and I am happy with it, I will buy a second light gun and a second cheap USB pedal, for friends and family to play with me on the TV.\n","permalink":"https://davidcraddock.games/time-crisis-2-setup/","summary":"Time Crisis 2 is a light-gun shooter arcade game developed and published by Namco.

Quite positive! Some initial thoughts:\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been a long-time BioWare fan since Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate, but was massively disappointed with Mass Effect: Andromeda, so much so that I didn\u0026rsquo;t even bother playing Anthem. I do like the setting and the characterisations in the Dragon Age series, and thought it was worth pre-ordering this game just in case they didn\u0026rsquo;t totally mess it up. Happily - it appears they didn\u0026rsquo;t! As a lot of reviewers have already noted, the game is \u0026ldquo;worlds away\u0026rdquo; from the start of the series in Dragon Age: Origins. This won\u0026rsquo;t please some people. Turn based combat is completely gone. The tone is much more light-hearted and upbeat, there is no dark blood dripping from our adventurers faces, instead there are a lot of light jokes and quite positive chit-chat really, considering the situation the characters are in. The dialogue so far hasn\u0026rsquo;t been amazing, but it\u0026rsquo;s entertaining and enjoyable, and dare I say - fun. The tone is nothing like wading through the serious darkness that is \u0026lsquo;Elden Ring\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Dark Souls\u0026rsquo;. I would compare it more to the dialogue in Neverwinter Nights II, which is one of my favourite games, although it doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear to be as good as the dialogue in that game. Actually, there are a lot of negatives in my work and personal life at the moment - so I\u0026rsquo;m absolutely enjoying a light-hearted adventure with the camaraderie and banter that I found mysteriously absent in Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate 3. The graphics are amazing. Playing in Ultra settings on my 1440p HDR monitor in a dark room is epic. The audio is great. There is a \u0026lsquo;dynamic range\u0026rsquo; setting so that you can make the most of high end audio equipment, which I\u0026rsquo;m lucky enough to have, and a 3D audio setting for headphones. Gamers moan at BioWare for being \u0026lsquo;woke\u0026rsquo; - but as a fully card-carrying member of the \u0026lsquo;woke\u0026rsquo; club myself, I see this as a benefit rather than a drawback. More to come as I get more into the game.\n","permalink":"https://davidcraddock.games/dragon-age-veilguard/","summary":"I pre-ordered Dragon Age: Veilguard, and started playing it as soon as it downloaded after release.\nFirst impressions?
