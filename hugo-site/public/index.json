[{"content":"This is a work in progress guide that I\u0026rsquo;m updating to be the \u0026lsquo;optimal\u0026rsquo; way of playing Time Crisis 2 on PC.\nThe current instructions require a 1080p screen and 2 footpedals, and enable 2 player mode with Sinden light guns.\nSoftware Required Time Crisis 2 (USA version) for PS2 - SLUS-210219 Use the latest CHD version from this ROM pack in the ps2.7z file.\nSinden Light Gun Utility Patched with support for Patched PCSX2 Emulator Sinden Light Gun Utility PCSX2 Emulator patched for Sinden Support PCSX2 Emulator Time Crisis 2 Target Gun Cursors Cursor pack Time Crisis 2 HD Retexture Pack (Paetron-supported) Throw him some money, it\u0026rsquo;s a thankless task!\nhttps://gbatemp.net/threads/my-ps2-packs.621422/ Notes This is for a 40\u0026quot; 1080p monitor/TV. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tested recoil with this setup yet.\nJoystick mode Ignore the instructions on the github telling you to put the lightuns in joystick mode. The latest release of the modified sinden lightgun plus PS2 emulator supports raw SDL mapping from the guns themselves, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to reply on the (broken) less accurate joystick mode.\nCalibration Trigger You need to set the bindings for \u0026lsquo;Trigger\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Off screen trigger\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Calibration shot\u0026rsquo; in the PSCX2 emulator to the SAME button you mapped to \u0026rsquo;trigger\u0026rsquo; in the modified lightgun app! This is because of a bug that means sometimes that these three buttons get wrongly assigned. Ignore any other instructions otherwise - this is the only way things will consistently work.\nCOM port Whenever you reconnect your lightguns the COM ports will change. You need to make a note of these! The best way to do this is to look on the \u0026lsquo;Firmware\u0026rsquo; tab of the modified lightgun settings app. NEVER update using this tab!! Instead just note down the COM port numbers.\nROMS Use this CHD for the game . You will need to use the USA Time Crisis II CHD and make sure the SLUS number matches exactly otherwise the config won\u0026rsquo;t work.\nBIOS You will need the official PS2 USA region bios\nHD Texture Pack The HD AI upscaled texture pack is available thanks to the efforts of . Please can you join his Patreon for the download link, or wait until he has one of his free weekends to download it.\nCrosshairs There is a bug with the modified PSCX2/lightgun emulator setup in that you can enable two crosshairs, but only one colour will be displayed for both crosshairs. None the less it is extremely useful to have a custom crosshair, and I recommend the crosshair pack mentioned above.\n16:9 Widescreen hack This unfortunately DOES NOT work with this setup. Hopefully it can eventually be made to work, as it would be substantially better.\nHacks and patches Make sure you accept the default hacks and patches in the modified Sinden app, and make sure you have load patches and hacks and cheats ON! Otherwise 2 player will not work.\nUSB setup Sinden light guns prefer seperate USB root hubs. My computer has a set of USB2 ports and a set of USB3 ports. This means it has two root hubs, one for the USB2 ports and one for the USB3. So I plug one lightgun into the USB2 port and one into the USB3.\nThe footpedals can be a bit sensitive about USB ports too. There will be a LED on each pedal USB connector so you can make sure that you have a good connection - when it is lit RED then everything is fine.\nWindows 11 Setup - BEFORE each play! This is only tested on the latest version of W11. The whole setup has may bugs and is quite \u0026lsquo;beta\u0026rsquo; in a lot of ways - there is a lot of hacking going on behind the scenes! So I suggest these measures:\nMake sure only the minimum services are running on W11 login. Use the windows task manager and the \u0026lsquo;startup apps\u0026rsquo; tab to turn off anything non-essential. Reboot every time before you start running the game. If you have been using a different Sinden lightgun config app setup, make SURE you go into the MODIFIED lightgun config app and click apply and save on EACH tab EXCEPT the firmware tab! This will ensure that your lightgun is setup with the correct settings for the PSCX2 setup. Multiple monitors/screens Just don\u0026rsquo;t. Minimise the things that can go wrong by disconnecting any other displays before loading the config.\nMultiple gaming controllers Just don\u0026rsquo;t. Minimise the things that can go wrong by disconnecting any non-keyboard and mouse controllers, such as arcade sticks, gamepads etc, before loading the config.\nLighting considerations I play in a dark room with blackout curtains drawn, a pair of electric fans on, and the door closed. Only one screen is on, and that is the main screen. This ensures the lightguns get the best accuracy.\nAs it will be dark, I recommend you tape down the wires for your footswitches and light guns wherever possible, to avoid trip hazards.\nDistance from the screen considerations This is standard for all Sinden setups, but make sure your are positioned with the foot pedals and guns the required distance away from your screen. Look up on the internet the ideal distance you should be from the screen, it depends on how big your screen is.\nSetup 1: Foot pedals I use 2 of these cheap but sturdy metal footswitch pedals. They work OK, probably not the best, but the best for the price: https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07Z1VDLK1\nWhen the pedal is depressed it functions like a keypress. You need to set a key that the keypress will activate in the setup utiltity for both foot pedals, obviously pick different keys for each pedal. Make sure you label the pedal for each gun - I have a red sticker on one because I have a red light gun, for example.\nFor the purposes of the ini file I provide below, I have the following keys mapped:\n1 2 Lightgun 1 \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; (period/fullstop) Lightgun 2 \u0026#34;,\u0026#34; (comma) Setup 2: Modified Lightgun app Make sure you use the UNMODIFIED OFFICAL app ONLY to update the firmware! Otherwise you potentially may brick your lightguns. Make sure you are running the latest firmware available from the 2.07 version of the official lightgun app for this setup. Keep the UNMODIFIED OFFICIAL lightgun app seperate, use this modified lightgun app ONLY with PSCX2 Recommended settings for the modified lightgun settings are as follows -\nBorder tab: No outer border. 2% inner border\nLightgun 1 Keybindings: a,b,c,d,e,f,g etc from the top to bottom for BOTH offscreen and onscreen.\nLightgun 2 Keybindings: 0,1,2,3,4,5,.. etc from the top to bottom for BOTH offscreen and onscreen\nOffset tab: RESET the offset so the values are\n1 2 3 4 0 1 0 1 Do not use the manual offset (turn it off)\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t get the offset values right then the aiming will be off and it will be a frustrating gaming experience.\nSetup 3: Modified PSCX2 Emulator Launch the modified PSCX2 Emulator for the first time and run the game. Then close both the game and the emulator. It should have generated a ini file in the inis directory. Open it with notepad. Find each stanza e.g. \u0026ldquo;[InputSources]\u0026rdquo; listed in your ini file. Delete each one and replace them with the values below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 [InputSources] Keyboard = true Mouse = true SDL = true DInput = false XInput = false SDLControllerEnhancedMode = false SDLRawInput = true [USB1] Type = guncon2 guncon2_cursor_path = ..\\..\\Crosshairs\\Crosshairs\\Custom Crosshair Gold.png guncon2_Gun4IRComPort = 4 guncon2_scale_x = 0 guncon2_Trigger = Keyboard/A guncon2_ShootOffscreen = Keyboard/A guncon2_Recalibrate = Keyboard/A guncon2_A = Keyboard/Period guncon2_B = Keyboard/F guncon2_C = Keyboard/E guncon2_Start = Keyboard/1 guncon2_Select = Keyboard/Q guncon2_Up = SDL-0/Button27 guncon2_Down = SDL-0/Button28 guncon2_Left = SDL-0/Button29 guncon2_Right = SDL-0/Button30 guncon2_screen_height = 240 guncon2_scale_y = 0 guncon2_custom_config = false [USB2] Type = guncon2 guncon2_cursor_path = ..\\..\\Crosshairs\\Crosshairs\\Custom Crosshair Green.png guncon2_Trigger = Keyboard/0 guncon2_A = Keyboard/Comma guncon2_Select = Keyboard/W guncon2_ShootOffscreen = Keyboard/0 guncon2_Recalibrate = Keyboard/0 guncon2_B = Keyboard/2 guncon2_C = Keyboard/4 guncon2_Start = Keyboard/2 guncon2_Gun4IRComPort = 5 guncon2_Up = SDL-1/Button27 guncon2_Down = SDL-1/Button28 guncon2_Left = SDL-1/Button29 guncon2_Right = SDL-1/Button30 guncon2_scale_x = 0 guncon2_scale_y = 0 guncon2_custom_config = false Replace the COM ports in the ini file with the COM ports corresponding to the COM ports mentioned on the modified sinden \u0026lsquo;firmware\u0026rsquo; app. Note that every time you reconnect the lightguns you will have to look this up again as they may change. Replace the guncon2_cursor_path paths with the custom crosshair you downloaded earlier. Note that due to a bug it will only use two copies of the first one, but set both of them anyway. Launch the emulator and load the PS2 ROM. You should notice that textures cheats and hacks should be loaded, and the game will run. Exit the game. Change the PER GAME settings on the Sinden app for optimal video play. These are the optimal settings, I have a Nvidia 4070 graphics card, 32GB DDR4 RAM and a 12th Gen i7 CPU, so assuming you have a similar setup, these settings will look the best: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Internal Resolution: 1080p Texture Filtering\tBilinear (PS2) Anisotropic Filtering\t16x Anti-Aliasing (FXAA)\tOn Dithering\tOff Blending Accuracy\tBasic (raise if issues arise) Post-Processing Shaders\tScanlines Playing the game One thing to note is the gun config at the start - what you should do is take the light gun it mentions and shoot the centre of the crosshair from different angles until the custom cursor AND the game cursor line up. When they line up, press the foot pedal for that gun, and that gun is configured.\nNow you are finally ready to play the game!\n","permalink":"https://davidcraddock.games/time-crisis-2-1-player-sinden/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is a work in progress guide that I\u0026rsquo;m updating to be the \u0026lsquo;optimal\u0026rsquo; way of playing Time Crisis 2 on PC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current instructions require a 1080p screen and 2 footpedals, and enable 2 player mode with Sinden light guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"software-required\"\u003eSoftware Required\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTime Crisis 2 (USA version) for PS2 - SLUS-210219\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUse the latest CHD version from \u003ca href=\"https://archive.org/details/lightgunsbatocera\"\u003ethis ROM pack\u003c/a\u003e in the ps2.7z file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"sinden-light-gun-utility-patched-with-support-for-patched-pcsx2-emulator\"\u003eSinden Light Gun Utility Patched with support for Patched PCSX2 Emulator\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/nixxou/SindenSoft/releases/tag/V1\"\u003eSinden Light Gun Utility\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"pcsx2-emulator-patched-for-sinden-support\"\u003ePCSX2 Emulator patched for Sinden Support\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/nixxou/pcsx2/releases/tag/V1.1\"\u003ePCSX2 Emulator\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"time-crisis-2-target-gun-cursors\"\u003eTime Crisis 2 Target Gun Cursors\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mega.nz/folder/IiMzQTzR#yf8BWqult3kILq6dVPp4ZQ\"\u003eCursor pack\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"time-crisis-2-hd-retexture-pack-paetron-supported\"\u003eTime Crisis 2 HD Retexture Pack (Paetron-supported)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrow him some money, it\u0026rsquo;s a thankless task!\u003c/p\u003e","title":"2 player Time Crisis 2 with Sinden Light Gun on PCSX2"},{"content":"I setup and played the \u0026lsquo;Epoch\u0026rsquo; rail-shooter game available on steam, with my Sinden light gun setup.\nNegatives I have to say, I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the mechanics of the game.

I also have 4x cables to connect GBAs to the Nintendo Gamecube for multiplayer games that used this functionality, and a headphone adaptor for the GBA SP. Original Gameboy which I use with Tetris.

It is minimal because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t like overcomplicated tech stuff :) It consists of:\nSony BRAVIA 2023 Edition, KD-43X75WL, 43 Inch, LED, Smart TV, 4K HDR, Google TV Because it has Google TV, we can use the Plex app to wirelessly stream 4K videos from my Plex server, and it handles 4K videos well, which is not a small feat as the wireless signal is being blasted through a concrete wall :) Netflix and all the other standard services also work well.\n","permalink":"https://davidcraddock.games/Setup/","summary":"\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative;

But I could never really afford one, in terms of time and space. Recently I thought to myself, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not getting any younger\u0026rdquo;. So I built an arcade setup mostly just using the things I already had in the home.\nGames The ROMs I have are all stored on my file server upstairs. I can get around a 3gbits/sec connection via my 10gbits/sec home network, so there is no performance \u0026lsquo;hit\u0026rsquo; in streaming them off the network drive - it has similar speed and latency to a physical drive. Which is handy, because my ROM collection is way too big for the storage on my gaming PC.\nArcade Games https://home.davidcraddock.net/PlayNiteHTMLExport/default%20list%20text%20combobox%20quicklinks_platform_ascending_name_ascending.html#quicklink-Arcade shows the arcade games that are currently playable on the setup. I am slowly adding more to the list, once I get the right metadata for them and verify each one is working.\nLight Gun Games https://home.davidcraddock.net/PlayNiteHTMLExport/default%20list%20text%20combobox%20quicklinks_category_ascending_name_ascending.html#quicklink-Light%20Gun%20Games shows the light gun games (both PC native and arcade) that are currently playable on the setup. Again, I am adding more to the list as I go through.\nSoftware Playnite I use PlayNite as the \u0026lsquo;hub\u0026rsquo; where I access all my games, arcade, retro or modern. PlayNite is - hands down - one of the best piece of open source software I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen, let alone used for gaming specifically.\nI have a setup which automatically downloads from Youtube a trailer for each game and ROM I have, so you can see the game in action before playing it.\nRetroArch For emulation, I use RetroArch under PlayNite. I put off moving to RetroArch for some time and struggled with using individual emulators, but I should have just gone with it from the start. Now I know how to use it, it\u0026rsquo;s the best tool for what I want to do - which is emulate many games on dozens of different systems. I just have to configure the controllers for RetroArch ONCE and it will map them fairly easily onto each individual emulator core, which is very very handy!\nIt uses a system of having multiple third-party \u0026lsquo;cores\u0026rsquo; which slot in to the main RetroArch program.\nFBNeo RetroArch Core The FinalBurn Neo RetroArch Core is essentially an arcade machine emulator, not unlike MAME. It will emulate most types of arcade board prior to 2012 or so, including the Neo Geo AES, which is the one most of my ROMs are based around.\nHardware Arcade Sticks I use two Arcade Sticks that I\u0026rsquo;ve had for a while to control the arcade games. Both have 8-way directional joysticks and at least 6 arcade style buttons.\nMayflash Arcade Stick F300 Elite This is the arcade stick that I generally use as it\u0026rsquo;s the better of the two. It has genuine Swarma arcade buttons and a American style arcade joystick, which makes the arcade experience more like a \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; arcade machine\nDatel Arcade Pro Joystick This is the \u0026lsquo;guest\u0026rsquo; arcade stick. It is a fairly cheap but functional arcade stick, that I\u0026rsquo;m looking to upgrade to a second F300 Elite in the future.\nSinden Light-Gun (Black) with recoil This is the light-gun that I use most of the time, as it\u0026rsquo;s the more expensive one with recoil. It is from SindenLightgun.com and works very well with all types of screens I\u0026rsquo;ve tested it on, at all angles.\nSinden Light-Gun (Red) without recoil This is the \u0026lsquo;guest\u0026rsquo; light gun for 2 player light-gun games.\nWireless keyboard and Mouse So that I can control things easier from just the standing position at the arcade table, I am using a cheap bluetooth keyboard and mouse for any config needed for the emulators, etc.\nAudio and Visual TV This is a 40\u0026quot; Sony TV which is 1080p and I bought it I think in 2015. The picture is still good. It is connected to my gaming PC.\nSpeakers I have two cheap Logitech speakers attached to the HDMI audio output of the TV. They are not great, but they are good enough for the arcade setup. I have other, much better speakers, but they are not in the right place for the arcade setup.\nGoogle Home Routine When I say \u0026lsquo;Hey google arcade\u0026rsquo; to my Google Home Mini voice assistant, it configures the smart devices and plugs in the \u0026lsquo;Dave Cave\u0026rsquo; so that it is optimal for arcade gaming, e.g. - it turns off the lights, turns off all the other 3 screens, puts on the lava lamps, and turns on the gaming PC speakers and sub-woofer.\nFurniture I\u0026rsquo;m currently using an old garden table, and a crate, with a black cloth draped over it! Very budget. Maybe at some point I will get a more expensive table, but this setup holds everything at an ergonomic height so you can use the controllers and light guns with the TV at a good distances.\nPossible Improvements I want to add more RetroArch cores so that I can play more than arcade games on the setup - I should be able to play all retro console games too. Although this is not essential at this point. I am going through games and adding them one-by-one to the setup, once I have verified they work and that the metadata is correct. I want to add footswitches and configure them so that I can play Time Crisis 2 with the \u0026lsquo;cover\u0026rsquo; switch mechanic. I want to experiment with using my Hue Entertainment area to add context-sensitive lighting to the gaming experience.
