It was released in arcades in 1997, and later ported to the PlayStation 2 in 2001. It is the second instalment in the Time Crisis series.\nThe game features a two-player mode, where each player takes turns using a light gun to shoot enemies and reload. Players can duck behind cover to avoid enemy fire, and pop out to shoot enemies. The game also features a pedal that players can step on to pop out of cover and shoot enemies.\nI remember playing Time Crisis 2 in arcades when I was a kid. It was one of my favourite games to play with friends. The light gun was so much fun to use, and the pedal added an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay. I also loved the graphics and sound effects, which really added to the immersive experience.\nI recently bought a Sinden Light Gun with recoil to use with my PC via an emulator. I decided to get Time Crisis 2 and set it up to work with it, as I had a lot of fun in the arcades on it.\nI bought a second-hand PS2 Time Crisis 2 disc from ebay, and used the PS2 redump.org dumping guide to dump the PS2 iso for use with the PCSX2 PC PS2 emulator. I could have downloaded the image illegally but I really avoid doing that unless I absolutely have to.\nEven though you can get the Sinden Light Gun to work directly with my physical PS2 console via some hardware hackery, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do that, and preferred to use the PCSX2 emulator.\nWhen the Sinden Light Gun arrives, I am intending to get Time Crisis 2 running now on my 42\u0026quot; 1080p screen TV, with the Sinden light gun software working, and a cheap USB pedal for reload.\nI will also use Phillips Hue for lighting in my room so that the Phillips Hue home entertainment system and the lightstrip around my TV matches the colours of the edges of the TV.\nSound will be provided by my 2.1 sound system, EQ\u0026rsquo;d to the characteristics of my room by SonorWorks SoundID.\nIf this setup all works and I am happy with it, I will buy a second light gun and a second cheap USB pedal, for friends and family to play with me on the TV.\n","permalink":"https://davidcraddock.games/time-crisis-2-setup/","summary":"Time Crisis 2 is a light-gun shooter arcade game developed and published by Namco.
