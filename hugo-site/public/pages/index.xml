      <title>My Home Retro Arcade Setup</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted an arcade machine in my home. But I could never really afford one, in terms of time and space. Recently I thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not getting any younger&amp;rdquo;. So I built an arcade setup mostly just using the things I already had in the home.
Games The ROMs I have are all stored on my file server upstairs. I can get around a 3gbits/sec connection via my 10gbits/sec home network, so there is no performance &amp;lsquo;hit&amp;rsquo; in streaming them off the network drive - it has similar speed and latency to a physical drive.</description>
